# RED-CMS 5.0

RED-CMS is a lightweight PHP and MySQL content management system for structured, template-driven websites. Version 5.0 modernizes the legacy application while preserving its public URLs, existing database table names, and compatibility-first deployment model.

The current release adds a consistent administrator workspace, standard theme packages, visual page structures, reusable layouts, content version history, safer database migrations, and repeatable acceptance testing.

## Release Status

RED-CMS 5.0 Bonsai and Milestone 5 are complete on `main`. The release
checkpoint was merged through [pull request #2](https://github.com/orojas01-glitch/redcms/pull/2)
on July 25, 2026.

Version 5.1 development includes per-page SEO compatibility,
non-executing add-on trust validation, persisted Owner authorization, and
per-client package registry/migration-ledger storage with read-only drift
reporting. A server-local Owner-authorized installer can apply reviewed,
checksum-verified package migrations and always records the package as
`installed_disabled`; it never executes package PHP. A separate read-only
Owner-authorized preflight can inspect that disabled package's dependency,
capability, and route readiness without changing state or loading code. Add-on
activation/runtime, upgrade, disable/uninstall/purge, payment, member access,
editorial workflow, notifications, the broader role model, and social
publishing integrations are not active features.

## Highlights

- Polished, responsive administrator workspace
- Article, Banner, Form, FTP, Gallery, Other, and Video authoring
- Parent-backed Sections, Categories, and Subcategories
- Three-level top navigation
- Direct drag-and-drop component positioning
- Reusable Layout Builder with desktop and mobile maps
- Non-destructive content version history and restoration
- Local, provider-independent TinyMCE compatibility editor
- Standard theme contract with validation, preview, activation, and rollback
- Prepared database operations, CSRF enforcement, scoped permissions, and transactional writes
- Migration ledger, guarded backup/restore tools, and disposable acceptance testing
- Read-only add-on manifest, path, compatibility, dependency, and integrity validation
- Per-client Owner role and exact future add-on lifecycle capability grants
- Empty per-client add-on installation/migration registries with fail-closed reconciliation
- Owner-authorized server-local package installation that remains disabled and unloaded
- Deterministic read-only enablement preflight with dependency and namespace conflict reporting

## Portable Starter Distribution

This repository is the clean, reusable RED-CMS distribution. It ships with the
`starter-reference` theme as the default public theme and keeps
`legacy-bootstrap` only as the hard recovery renderer.

Client themes, client media, and client databases are intentionally excluded.
Site-specific installations must be backed up and distributed separately so a
clean release can never overwrite retained production content.

## Local Development

The verified local environment uses:

- PHP 8.5.8 through FrankenPHP
- MySQL 8.4 LTS
- MySQL at `127.0.0.1:3307`
- Portable starter at `http://127.0.0.1:8055/`
- Starter administrator at `http://127.0.0.1:8055/admin/`

From the repository root:

```bash
scripts/dev-mysql-status.sh
scripts/dev-mysql-start.sh
scripts/dev-php-server.sh
```

Check service state first and start only services that are stopped. Local credentials belong in the ignored `includes/config.local.php`; never commit that file.

Detailed setup notes:

- [Clean installation](INSTALL.md)
- [Local PHP runtime](docs/LOCAL-DEV-PHP.md)
- [Local database](docs/LOCAL-DEV-DATABASE.md)
- [Database migrations](docs/DATABASE-MIGRATIONS.md)

## Verification

Verify that the tracked package contains only portable starter defaults:

```bash
php scripts/clean-starter-boundary-self-test.php
```

Run PHP syntax checks:

```bash
scripts/dev-php-lint.sh
```

Run the theme and administrator contract suite:

```bash
php scripts/theme-contract-self-test.php
```

Run the non-executing add-on trust gate:

```bash
php scripts/addon-trust-self-test.php
php scripts/addon-validate.php --all
php scripts/admin-addon-owner.php --status
php scripts/addon-registry-status.php --all
php scripts/admin-addon-install.php --package=vendor.package --actor-admin=ID
php scripts/admin-addon-enable-preflight.php --package=vendor.package --actor-admin=ID
```

The install command is a dry run by default. Apply requires the exact database,
package, version, plan digest, SHA-256 from a separately verified backup, and
`installed_disabled` confirmations printed by the dry run. Package files are
deployed separately per client; the clean starter intentionally contains no
`addons/` directory. The enablement preflight is always read-only: it has no
apply mode, keeps `enableReady` false while runtime registration is unavailable,
does not change the package's `installed_disabled` state, and does not execute
package PHP.

Run the complete guarded acceptance lifecycle:

```bash
scripts/dev-acceptance.sh
```

The acceptance runner creates a uniquely named temporary database, refuses the configured primary database, exercises migrations and representative CMS operations, and removes only its exact temporary database, grant, server, media, and fixture artifacts.
It runs the clean-starter boundary check before creating any disposable
database.

## Database And Release Safety

- Back up a retained database before migrations or release work.
- Test migrations first against a disposable restored copy.
- Never edit an applied migration.
- Preserve public URL and table-name compatibility unless a separate migration explicitly approves a change.
- Keep every client database, media archive, and rollback point outside the clean starter release.
- Review and merge release branches through pull requests; do not publish directly from an unverified dirty worktree.
